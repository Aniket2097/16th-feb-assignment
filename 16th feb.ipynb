    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are commonly used in software applications and systems to store and manage information, such as customer data, inventory information, financial transactions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) databases and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables, columns, and rows, with a fixed schema that describes the structure of the data. SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manipulate data and perform operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. SQL databases are commonly used in business applications, such as finance, accounting, and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not have a fixed schema and are not based on the relational model. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they provide greater flexibility and scalability compared to SQL databases. NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family, to store and manipulate data. NoSQL databases are commonly used in web applications, social media, and big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Data Model: SQL databases use a fixed schema and are based on the relational model, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema and use a variety of data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data and provide greater scalability and flexibility than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Performance: NoSQL databases can provide faster performance for some types of operations, such as retrieving large volumes of data, compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to query and manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, such as MongoDB's query language for document-oriented databases or Cassandra's CQL for column-family databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the choice between a SQL or NoSQL database will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the application or system being developed."

    "Primary Key: A primary key is a field or a combination of fields in a table that uniquely identifies each row or record in that table. Each table can have only one primary key, and it is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that no two rows in the table have the same value for the primary key field(s). A primary key can be composed of one or more columns, and it is typically used as the basis for creating relationships with other tables. For example, in a database of customers and orders, the customer ID might be the primary key of the customers table.\n",

    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field or a combination of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, with the foreign key in one table pointing to the primary key of the other table. A foreign key ensures that data integrity is maintained between the two tables by preventing the creation of orphaned records in the referencing table. Orphaned records are records in the referencing table that do not have a corresponding record in the referenced table. For example, in a database of customers and orders, the order table might have a foreign key column that references the customer ID primary key in the customers table.\n",
